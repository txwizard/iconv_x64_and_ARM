# ZLib for Windows ReadMe

The purpose of this repository is to publish a port of the famous ZLib (zlib,
for purists - you know who you are) library for creating Zip archives and
extracting files from them to Windows 10 running on ARM processors such as the
Qualcomm Snapdragon series, such as the one inside the Asus ASUS NovaGo TP370QL,
about which you can learn more at
<https://www.asus.com/us/2-in-1-PCs/ASUS-NovaGo-TP370QL/>.

This code builds on the latest version of iconv published on the official site,
at <https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/>, adding a configuration for ARM.

For completeness, this repository includes the __Win32__ (32 bit Windows on
Intel/AMD) binaries.

## Using These Libraries

If you have any edition of Visual Studio 2017 installed on a 64-bit copy of
Microsoft Windows, and you intend to use only the 64-bit Intel libraries, you
may skip the rest of this section, because the required runtime libraries are
already installed.

Otherwise, please keep reading, especially if your target is an ARM processor,
since the Microsoft C runtime for ARM is tucked away, and finding them took
many searches, spread across about a week, to find a proper package. Moreover,
extracting them from that package requires some specialized knowledge about the
internal format of a NuGet package.

To use these libraries on any supported platform, you must acquire and install
the Microsoft« C Runtime Library, version 14.00.24234.1 or later, called
`vcruntime140.dll` on all platforms. Microsoft distributes it as part of the
"Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3 RC" package, available from
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52685> for Intel and
AMD CPUs, and from <https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v2/package/vc-runtime/2.0.0/>
for ARM processors.

- The __Intel/AMD__ packages come as self-extracting `EXE` files, one each for
__x86__ (32 bits) and __x64__ (64 bits). Though they are packaged separately, the
download page offers the option of fetching both in one pass. If you take that
option, you should elect to dwonload both, then view the packages in your
`Downloads` folder. This suggestion applies to Edge and Chrome for certain, and
is sound advice for other Web browsers. Though technically self-extracting
archives, manually extracting them makes clear that they are intended to be
executed, so that the executable code embedded therein can reassemble the
numerous bits into a handful of program files before it installs them.

- The __ARM__ package comes as a `.nupkg` that can be renamed to `.zip`, and
treated as an ordinary ZIP archive. Both __ARM__ and __ARM64__ (32 and 64 bit)
runtimes come in one package. To get the goods, extract the archive into a new
directory, and use the file explorer to drill down into it. Inside directory
`content\VC\Redist\MSVC\14.14.26405\onecore` are two subdirectories, helpfully
named `arm` and `arm64`. Unlike the Intel/AMD packages, the __ARM__ package is
a straightforward, if opaque, ZIP archive, and the contents of the two leaf
directories need only to be copied into a directory that is in your __PATH__
list, and they are ready for use.

For those who are interested, the directory structure in the NuGet package
reflects the location into which the files are installed into Visual Studio
when you install the ARM compilers and tools.

To get the tools for Microsoft Visual Studio, start the __Visual Studio Installer__,
which should be on the main list of __Programs__ (not APPs), answer the UAC
prompt, and select the __Modify__ button. Once the form draws itself, select the
__Individual Components__ tab, and scroll down almost to the bottom, where you will
eventually find __Visual C++ compilers and libraries for ARM and ARM64__, listed as
two items. Check either or both, and click __Modify__. When the installer is done,
you are ready to go.
